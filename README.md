# CSICI526_MessUp

## Game Components- 5 different Coloured dots, 5 countdown bins, a countdown timer, scoreboard and a magic dot. 

## GOAL 
To match dots of the same color within a time limit. The player will reach the next level only when all the bins have counted down to zero within the time limit for that level.

## Available moves 
The player can move in 4 directions-up, down, left and right.

## Make a match 
Click on a dot and swipe in any of the available directions to make a match. The matched dots will disappear and new dots of random color would drop from the top. 
The bin counter of the matched color will go down by the number of dots matched.

## Score 
Each dot has a weight of 1, so the score would increase by the number of dots present in a match. At the end of each level, the score would equal addition of countdown number of all bins.


## Special features
Magic dot- A magic dot will appear if the player makes a match in the form of a closed loop. 
Conditions- there is a 5 second time limit to use the magic dot. It will lapse, i.e., will become an ordinary dot of a random color if not used within the time limit. 

## Features/functions associated with the magic 
dot-Mobility- the magic dot can be moved around in the board, but only once.
Adaptability- can be matched with dot of any other color. 
Matching 2 or more magic dots will eliminate all the dots in the corresponding rows and columns. The bins will countdown to the number of each coloured dot present in those rows and columns.
